# Data-prediction---AI
This project works on data extracted from a personal strategy. 
The data was extracted from ----- and automatically imported into Excel. 
The strategy has a win rate of approximately 40% and a r:r is 1:4. The goal of this project is to implement various artificial intelligence algorithms to #predict and increase the win rate.
